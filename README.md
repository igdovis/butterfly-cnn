# Butterfly classification with CNN

A project to explore different CNN architectures and parameter settings, while also exploring the power of Streanlit. Streamlit is an open-source framework to turn ML/Data scripts into web apps, without any frontend. The framework is extremely simple to use, and can be highly beneficial in presentations and showing off your data/ML project to others. Check out https://streamlit.io/ for documentation and more.

## TODOs
There are some todo's I'd like to implement.
- Connecting to a SQL database
- N-shot learning and updating the butterfly database, whenever a new, unseen butterfly species is presented
